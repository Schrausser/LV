title="Exposure",
bookTitle="Mastering Photography",
year="1995",
publisher="Macmillan Education UK",
address="London",
pages="76--87",
abstract="In simple terms, exposure is the act of pressing the shutter release on the camera and allowing light to fall on the film. In practice it is the result of a number of calculations and operations. The way in which light levels are calculated, the choice of aperture, shutter speed and film all have a direct effect on exposure. Correct exposure is having just the right amount of light reaching the film to give you a negative or transparency of normal density and contrast. It therefore follows that if a film does not receive sufficient light an under exposed image will result; on the other hand one that receives too much light will be over exposed. That is not to say that every image should be given correct exposure; much will depend on artistic interpretation",

In this chapter, we will study powers as functions of a variable exponent, i.e., y = bx: To do this, we must first define bxwhen x is not a rational number. This we do in Section 6.1; the rest of the chapter is devoted to the differential and integral calculus of the exponential functions y = bxand their inverses, the logarithms. The special value b = e = 2.7182818285... leads to especially simple formulas",

title={Automatic exposure algorithms for digital photography},
journal={Multimedia Tools and Applications},
pages={12751--12776},
volume={79},
number={19},
abstract={In this paper we deal with the problem of calculating Automatic Exposure (AE) in digital cameras. The main problem that often occurs when taking pictures is correct exposure setting. Typically, smartphones with built-in cameras, as well as “cheap” compact digital cameras do not offer possibility of manual exposure setting. The reason is that users do not have knowledge how to set the optimal exposure, or just simply do not want to do this. Therefore, it forces that user has to rely on automatic exposure algorithms implemented in the camera. Unfortunately, these algorithms often do not perform well what causes improperly exposed images. In this paper, new algorithms for automatic exposure are proposed with the special focus on minimizing overexposed areas in the images. We have implemented proposed algorithms and conducted experiments for their efficiency, comparing with some modern cameras or smartphones. Experimental verification (enhanced by statistical analysis) shows that proposed algorithms give statistically less overexposed areas than comparative AEs},
